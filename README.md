# web-scraping-challenge
Using the app flask and scraping the nasa websites for key Mars details and images, I collected and displayed the items on a webite. There I also added a button to run the scraping again and refresh the data.

## Technologies
Using jupyter noteobok and python, I did an initial web scraping of the details and images that I wanted to display on the webpage. Later converting it to a scrape file that would connect with the app.py that runs the flask. Within the flask, the homepage runs the index.html where it displays said details and generates the option to re-scrape any necessary information. 

## Additional Notes
To run the app.py, clone the repo and download any necessary packages that may be required to support any of the web scraping or app.py packages.
